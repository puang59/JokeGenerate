## Why are you making simple and TRASH websites? 
I made this webssite to polish my long forgotten JavaScript skills. 
Its my baby step to get into web development and explore more about JavaScript.

## Sucks at responsive design
I am really bad at front-end desigining i.e. CSS so please ignore it

## icanhazdadjoke
